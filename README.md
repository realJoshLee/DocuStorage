# Tasks - By Josh Lee
## _A minimal and useful task manager that you control._
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

## Updating
All of the users data is pulled from a MariaDB SQL server so updating code to a newer release is as simple as it can be. When a new relase comes along, download the code from the repo and place it on your web server.

## Features
- Open source, so you can self host this on your server and have control over your data.
- Whitelist domains so you don't have random people creating accounts.
- Minimal UI with Light and Dark themes.
- Entirely built on HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. That means that there isn't any compiling to be done to edit this. Edit some code and push it to your web server.

## Setup
1. Push all files to your webserver.
2. Navigate to the following URL and finish the setup: https://yourdomain.com/setup.php

## License
This form isn't required but it's nice to see the quanity of who self hosts our app and to have emails incase of we need to notify our users. This data is not sold or rented to other companies.
